API Pentesting stands as most emerging and crucial asset for evolving security requirements. In this article, You could expect Resources to setup API Pentest environment from scratch using Postman & Burp / OWASP Zap proxy, Relevant Key points to understand API and it's diversities, Common vulnerabilities in API and it's Impacts, methodologies to replicate attacks, OWASP Top 10 for API, 31-days of API Security based learning and hints, Relevant People to follow on twitter, Video based resources and Youtube channels to follow, Books and More. 

All the resources I post here aren't completely mine and credits goes to the creators/Authors and I am extremely thankful to the community for creating the resources.

The Best resource to get started ( It Personally helped me a lot ) Is by **Mr.Saumya prakash rana** -

[API Security Testing-1 ](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/api-security-testing-part-1-b0fc38228b93)

It discusses about 
* What is an API ?
* Types of APIs
* Complete Setup using Postman & Burp suite
* Way to import API Calls.
* Different layers of tests for APIs (Analyzing Access tokens, Refresh tokens, Input validation test, Authentication test)

Before we go ahead, You will need to understand how to use POSTMAN and how it works, along with how to create API calls if it is not provided in documentation. I would like you to go through the following playlist to get greater clarity before proceeding ahead.
[Postman Beginner tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhW3qG5bs-L-oT0GenwPLcJAPD_SiFK3C)

At this point, Your environment is setup for API penetration testing and Interception will happen via Burp suite. To get more clarity on burp suite or Owasp Zap proxy you could follow below links.
* [Burp suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started)
* [OWASP ZAP Proxy](https://www.zaproxy.org)

The Article below contains advanced attack process-
[API Security Testing-2 ](https://medium.com/@saumyaprakashrana_51250/api-security-testing-part-2-67ae9fb9c12)

It discusses about
* XML external entity (XXE) injection
* Server side request forgery (SSRF)

By Now you would have basic gist of general security loopholes and methodologies. Before we proceed further, It is important that you watch the following videos and Understand the contents of it in depth to gain more clarity.
