API Pentesting stands as most emerging and crucial asset for evolving security requirements. In this article, You could expect Resources to setup API Pentest environment from scratch using Postman & Burp / OWASP Zap proxy, Relevant Key points to understand API and it's diversities, Common vulnerabilities in API and it's Impacts, methodologies to replicate attacks, OWASP Top 10 for API, 31-days of API Security based learning and hints, Relevant People to follow on twitter, Video based resources and Youtube channels to follow, Books and More. 

All the resources I post here aren't completely mine and credits goes to the creators/Authors and I am extremely thankful to the community for creating the resources.

The Best resource to get started ( It Personally helped me a lot ) Is by **Mr.Saumya prakash rana** -

[API Security Testing-1 ](https://medium.com/datadriveninvestor/api-security-testing-part-1-b0fc38228b93)

It discusses about 
* What is an API ?
* Types of APIs
* Complete Setup using Postman & Burp suite
* Way to import API Calls.
* Different layers of tests for APIs (Analyzing Access tokens, Refresh tokens, Input validation test, Authentication test)

Before we go ahead, You will need to understand how to use POSTMAN and how it works, along with how to create API calls if it is not provided in documentation. I would like you to go through the following playlist to get greater clarity before proceeding ahead.
